Misa Bacon grew the reach and revenue of her company with help from Verizon Small Business Digital Ready. Photo credit: Tom Sanders When Dallas-based bookkeeper Misa Bacon discovered Verizon Small Business Digital Ready, she wasn’t expecting it to transform her business — but it did. By applying lessons from the online learning platform’s free courses and live networking sessions, she more than doubled her incoming leads and grew overall revenue by over 50%. “I wish it was around when I first started,” Bacon says. “I probably would have done things differently had I known some of the information sooner.” That growth is especially meaningful given how Bacon’s entrepreneurial journey began: with a simple desire to learn and help others do the same. For Bacon, the path from corporate accountant to successful small business owner has been characterized by one thing: her endless curiosity. “I like to learn. I don't mind going and learning the information and figuring it out,” she says. Bacon traces her entrepreneurial spirit back to her mother, who left a government job to start her own day care service. “Seeing her, I knew it was possible,” she recalls. &nbsp; Bacon began her career in accounting and climbed her way up the corporate ladder. After rising to a managerial level over a decade, however, she found herself at a crossroads. “I got to a point where I reached a ceiling,” Bacon says. Inspired by her mother’s model of independence, she began exploring ways to start her own business. Bacon’s accounting experience had revealed a consistent pain point among small business clients: “Finance is always the area where business owners have fears — it’s just not their thing,” she says. Bacon decided to fill that need, offering bookkeeping services to help small businesses build a strong foundation for growth. “There’s a huge gap for [business] owners that need some level of support that isn’t really being met by the accounting industry,” she says. After a couple of years taking freelance clients, Bacon was ready to offer her services full time, and launched Perfectly Kept Books in 2020. “Now I have the opportunity to actually impact businesses, watch them grow and help them navigate challenges on the financial side,” she says. Bacon loves the person-to-person connection of working with fellow small business owners. Photo credit: Tom Sanders As her client base grew, Bacon looked for new ways to scale and streamline operations. “I’m always seeking out resources, any kind of help that I can get,” she says. She found that help with&nbsp; Verizon Small Business Digital Ready , and says she was thrilled to discover the free online learning platform. &nbsp; At first, she wanted to boost visibility beyond word-of-mouth referrals. After taking Digital Ready’s self-paced course, “Put Your Website to Work,” Bacon made adjustments to her website, such as using keywords and updating all of the content to optimize it for search engine results. Soon after, leads from search more than doubled referral traffic. “Someone reached out to me and told me she searched ‘Black bookkeeper in Dallas,’ and I was one of the top results that popped up,” Bacon says. Next she focused on email marketing. After completing the “Creating a Winning Strategy” course, she added newsletter sign-ups across her website, increasing subscribers by 27%. “I use email to share my perspective on bookkeeping tips or just my thoughts on business — whatever I think would be helpful,” she says. Bacon finds Digital Ready to be an outlet for her desire to learn that is yielding measurable results. Photo credit: Tom Sanders For Bacon, Digital Ready has become both a learning hub and a community. She joins live Peer to Peer Check Ins to swap advice and meet new potential clients. “When people find out I’m a bookkeeper, they’re like, ‘Oh, I might need to talk to you,’” she says. “It’s also a way for me to figure out what they’re struggling with,” Bacon says of her fellow entrepreneurs. “What do [customers] need? Then I can make sure to build services to support them.” Bacon also uses Digital Ready’s accounting curriculum to keep her skills sharp. “I like to see what the accountants are saying, especially the tax professionals,” she says. “I try to stay as up to date as possible.” Ultimately, Bacon says her favorite thing about Digital Ready is that it’s a place for small business owners to easily get answers. Over time, the insights she’s gained — from optimizing her website to expanding her email outreach and networking through live sessions — have added up to measurable results. “These are experts that are [teaching] you. I don't know if people understand just how valuable it actuall",

Subscribe to MediaDailyNews Verizon Asks SCOTUS To Review Privacy Fine by Wendy Davis , November 14, 2025 Verizon has asked the Supreme Court to review a lower court decision upholding a $47 million fine imposed by the Federal Communications Commission over alleged privacy violations. The telecom argues in a petition made public this week that the fine, which was imposed last year, violated the company's 7th Amendment right to a jury trial. Verizon adds that Supreme Court intervention is necessary to protect the right to trial by jury and \"to cabin a sweeping expansion of administrative power.\" The telecom's petition comes in a dispute dating to 2020, when the Federal Communications Commission first proposed fining Verizon, AT&amp;T and T-Mobile for selling access to customers' geolocation data to aggregators that then resold the information. In April 2024, the FCC imposed fines on the three carriers that amounted to around $200 million total&nbsp;–$47 million for Verizon, $57 million for AT&amp;T and $92 million for T-Mobile. advertisement advertisement The carriers paid the fines, then&nbsp; sued &nbsp;to vacate them. Verizon sued in the 2nd Circuit, while T-Mobile brought suit in the D.C. Circuit and AT&amp;T sued in the 5th Circuit. The carriers made similar arguments in the three appellate courts. Among other claims, the companies said the FCC violated their right to a jury trial by acting as both prosecutor and judge. The 2nd Circuit rejected Verizon's argument, ruling that its 7th Amendment right wasn't violated because it could have refused to pay the fine, and then defended itself at a jury trial if the FCC pressed to collect the money. \"Assuming Verizon has a Seventh Amendment right to a trial by jury, those rights were not violated because it had, but chose to forgo, an opportunity for a ...trial,\" the appellate panel wrote. Verizon now argues in its petition with the Supreme Court that it should have been able to make its case to a jury before the FCC ordered the company to pay a fine, not afterwards. The D.C. Circuit also rejected T-Mobile's argument and upheld its fine. But the 5th Circuit came to the opposite conclusion, ruling that the FCC violated AT&amp;T's right to a trial by jury. The FCC last month asked the Supreme Court to review that decision, arguing that it \"severely impairs the agency’s ability to enforce federal communications law.\" AT&amp;T is expected to respond to the FCC's argument in that matter by December 5. The FCC proposed the fines after it&nbsp; came to light &nbsp;that a Missouri sheriff used geolocation data provided by Securus Technology to track other law enforcement officers, without court orders. Securus obtained the location data from the phone carriers. Around one year later, Vice Media's Motherboard detailed how a journalist was able to pay a “bounty hunter” $300 to track a phone's location to a neighborhood in Queens. The major U.S. carriers have said they no longer sell location data. digital , fcc , legal , location-based , mobile , policy , privacy , telecom Comment Next story loading advertisement More from MediaDailyNews Court Sides With Quest In Privacy Battle Meta Defeats Antitrust Suit Over Instagram, WhatsApp Acquisitions Microsoft, Nvidia Invest Billions In Anthropic Realeyes Spins Off 'Adverteyes' To Focus On Ad Performance, Outcomes Meta Aims To Protect Creator-Made Reels From Unauthorized Duplication SPONSOR CONTENT Travel, Treats &amp; Traditions: How Multimodal AI Is Rewriting the Holiday Travel Story The Best Event in Email Marketing",
