I played against Vincent Kompany and Virgil van Dijk, but this underrated Premier League winner is one of my toughest opponents I faced But when asked to name the five toughest centre-backs he came up against throughout his career, Deeney threw a surprise name into the mix. Superstar duo lead Deeney's defender rankings Speaking to talkSPORT.com , Deeney listed Manchester City great Vincent Kompany as the man he looked forward to playing against the least. In the seven games Deeney came up against Kompany, he scored just one goal as the Belgian oozed class with every defensive action. Deeney was also full of praise for Liverpool skipper Virgil van Dijk , who has been a driving force behind the Reds' success in recent years.

Big, powerful, can play. Don't mind getting hit, don't mind dishing it out. \"They were just a level above everyone else.\" Third in Deeney's list was Chelsea icon John Terry , who was inducted into the Premier League's Hall of Fame in April 2024. Terry, a five-time Premier League winner, was leadership exemplified on and off the pitch but had the quality to match and is still the top flight's highest-scoring defender in league history, with a remarkable tally of 41.

Very, very good defender.\" But it was the final name in Deeney's five that may raise the most eyebrows. Former Foxes skipper earns surprise inclusion \"Do you know what, the one I had the most battles with was Wes Morgan ,\" Deeney said. \"He never got that much credit for his ability to read the game, organise and lead. They (Leicester City) won the league and no-one spoke about that backline.\" The pair first met on the pitch in March 2008, when Deeney and Morgan were at Walsall and Nottingham Forest respectively. Their on-field rivalry spanned an impressive 11 years, with their final encounter coming in March 2019 as Deeney got on the scoresheet for Watford in a 2-1 win over Leicester. 4 Morgan and Deeney were never afraid of using their physicality against one another Credit: Getty In total, Deeney and Morgan duelled 13 times, with both men enjoying five wins each while the former scored four goals, one of which was the iconic late strike for Watford against Leicester in the 2012/13 Championship play-off semi final. When asked whether there was a mutual respect between the pair given the physical nature of their battles, Deeney pointed to a captain's meeting prior to a match between Watford and Leicester in the Premier League that said it all. Pre-match moment explains Deeney and Morgan's duels over the years \"I played against Wes a few times in the Championship,\" Deeney said. \"The first time we played in the Premier League, the captains had to go in and speak. The ref was explaining the rules and I just said, 'Ref, let us fight at it.' \"And Wes went, 'Yeah, just let us fight.' \"If you watch that game, there was more or less no foul given on me and Wes. But if Wes touched another one of our players, it was a foul and vice versa. 4 Morgan and Deeney made a combined 335 appearances in the Premier League Credit: Getty \"I used to come off those games with scratches and pinch marks, but I loved it. That was a game of football for me. Wes was tough.\" Morgan sits in an exclusive club of 18, with that figure representative of the number of captains to have won the Premier League since its inception. Yet he undoubtedly sits atop that list as the unlikeliest of those to have led their team to glory given Leicester were famously 5000/1 to win the top flight going into their successful 2015/16 campaign. Morgan was one of only two members of the Foxes' title-winning squad to have played every minute that season, with Kasper Schmeichel the other individual in question.

According to Sky Germany, Eintracht’s Bundesliga rivals Bayern Munich, Borussia Dortmund, Bayer Leverkusen and RB Leipzig all have the 22-year-old on their radar. Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement However, the German media outlet also reports that enquiries have come from England and that a move to the Premier League currently appears most likely. Eintracht Frankfurt have set a €60 million price tag for Brown, which is described as too high for the German clubs. It’s far from certain that Brown will leave in the summer, though. The German international is under contract until 2030 and has no release clause, meaning Die Adler are under no pressure to sell.
