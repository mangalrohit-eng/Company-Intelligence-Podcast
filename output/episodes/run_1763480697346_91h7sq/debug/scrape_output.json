Peter Kneffel/dpa Amazon has hired around 12,000 seasonal workers in Germany ahead of the Black Friday and Christmas shopping rush, the company has said, marking an increase of roughly 3,000 compared with last year. The temporary staff will work at the company's logistics sites, performing roles such as package sorting. Delivery drivers, who operate as contractors, are not included. Most seasonal staff began in October, with the remainder starting in November. Contracts run until the end of the year. The hiring surge is partly due to new logistics sites, including two distribution centres. Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement Amazon Germany employs around 40,000 permanent staff. It said the additional seasonal workforce is necessary to handle the expected surge in orders during the peak holiday period. Amazon has operated its own delivery service in Germany for 10 years, during which it has delivered roughly five billion packages. According to the German Federal Network Agency, Amazon is the country's second-largest parcel carrier after DHL, handling between 15% and 25% of deliveries. Seasonal fluctuations are common among online retailers and parcel services. DHL also temporarily increases its workforce during peak periods.

INSIDER PHOTO ESSAY: Portraits of workers keeping Ukraine out of the dark Utility workers in Ukraine are risking their lives as they battle to keep the lights as Russia repeatedly attacks the energy system. The Associated Press interviewed several of the workers about their jobs and how they have changed since Russia's invasion of Ukraine almost four years ago.

For many shoppers that price is worth it. But if you only use Prime for free shipping the value disappears quickly. You would need to place around 20 orders a year just to break even on shipping alone. The good news is that you do not need Prime to get free shipping. Amazon offers free delivery once your order reaches the minimum amount, usually $35. Sometimes the threshold changes depending on the mix of items in your cart. When I tested this with a combination of products, Amazon told me I needed to spend at least $50 to qualify for free shipping without an Amazon Prime subscription. The Trick to Hitting the Free Shipping Threshold The challenge is reaching the right number without overspending. If your cart totals $47.97, Amazon adds a $6.99 delivery charge. Add one more item worth just over one dollar, and the delivery becomes free. It is one of the easiest ways to avoid paying for shipping during busy shopping seasons. There are websites such as Filler Checker that try to help by finding low-cost items that will nudge you over the line. In my testing, the tool was not always accurate. Some recommended products were unavailable or did not qualify. A better method is to search Amazon for inexpensive essentials. Pens. Batteries. Small toiletries. Travel-sized over-the-counter medicine. For example, Amazon sells a small pack of Tylenol for $2.49. Adding that to my cart removed the $6.99 delivery fee. I saved money and picked up something I will actually use. This strategy also works for Prime members who need to reach $25 to unlock free overnight shipping on eligible items. Set Yourself Up Before Black Friday If you shop on Amazon regularly, it helps to keep a few cheap items saved in your cart or wish list. Then, when you are just short of the minimum for free delivery, you can add one instantly without searching. This is especially helpful during Black Friday lightning deals when items disappear quickly and you do not have time to hunt for a filler item. Important Exceptions to Amazon Free Shipping Amazon’s shipping rules include a few exceptions. Orders must contain items that are fulfilled by Amazon or by a qualified seller. Some oversized or restricted products may not qualify. And the two-day clock does not start until the item is shipped. If an item takes a day or two to leave the warehouse, your delivery may arrive later than expected. Final Takeaway With a little planning, you can avoid delivery fees without paying for Prime. Keep a handful of low-cost essentials saved, watch your cart totals closely, and use the savings to your advantage during the busiest shopping season of the year.
