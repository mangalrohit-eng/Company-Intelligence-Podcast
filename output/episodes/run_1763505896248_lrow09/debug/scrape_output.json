Speaking exclusively to Virgilio , Vigorelli discussed the 20-year-old full-back, who made a move from Fiorentina to Brentford this past January. The agent highlighted how Kayode’s physical attributes have made the transition seamless. Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement Vigorelli on Kayode’s Success in England Vigorelli revealed his high satisfaction with the progress made by the young defender since arriving in England: “I am very happy with what Michael is doing. The Premier League is the championship tailor-made for him, his physicality allowed him to make an immediate impact. He is growing continuously; he too must continue on this path. He is a boy who has an important career ahead of him.” Vigorelli’s comments underscore the belief that Kayode’s skill set and athletic profile are ideally suited for the demands of English football, confirming the player’s immediate and continued development at the London-based club.

Who are the winners and losers from Thomas Tuchel's November England games With Ollie Watkins given a rest to overcome some niggling injuries, Tuchel decided against picking another frontman in his squad and suggested that if need be, he'd use one of the attackers at his disposal in a false nine role, which in turn we saw with Phil Foden's cameo against Serbia.&nbsp; It's a concerning factor that right now doesn't affect the national team, with Kane as good as he's ever been, but in a post-Kane world, it's difficult to see where a successor will come from.&nbsp; \"I can't see anyone coming through. I'm racking my brains to think of one,\" former England striker Robbie Fowler exclusively tells DAZN News , thanks to Adventure Gamers . &nbsp; Fowler was part of a generation that saw England spoilt for choice in Kane's position with the likes of Alan Shearer, Les Ferdinand, Michael Owen, Andy Cole, Teddy Sheringham and more all competing for spots alongside the Liverpool legend for a spot in the national team camp. Yet, when trying to think of another number nine who could even be back-up to the Bayern Munich star, Fowler is struggling to think of a name.&nbsp; He said, \"You think of the number nines to replace him… Ollie Watkins is not in the squad and he's coming towards the twilight years of his career. Michael Regan - The FA/The FA via Getty Images \"You’ve got Liam Delap at Chelsea. He's probably the one at the minute who you are probably thinking there's potential there. But will he ever score the goals that Harry Kane has scored? I don't think so. \"You can never say never, can you? But it's hard, isn't it? Because obviously formations dictate now that a lot of the top teams went out and signed forwards from overseas. \"It's hard to sort of sit and pinpoint the strikers who can come in because other than Kane, Tuchel hasn’t brought in anyone in as a number nine.\"&nbsp; How to watch the Premier League in Canada Soccer fans in Canada can watch every Premier League match during the 2025-26 season on DAZN.
