Rothschild &amp; Co Redburn downgraded Amazon and Microsoft stock this week. It said it failed to see a clear bull case due to key issues with the business model for AI firms. Confidence is already shaky in the AI trade, with top tech stocks selling off in recent weeks. One analyst has taken a dimmer view of two AI kingmakers this week. Alex Haissl, an analyst at Rothschild &amp; Co Redburn, is a lonely dissenting voice among research analysts when it comes to shares of Amazon and Microsoft . In a note to clients this week, Haissl downgraded the firm's rating on the tech giants despite the ongoing hype for generative AI and the billions both firms have pledged to spend on the new tech in the coming years. Investors look like they're valuing Amazon and Microsoft's capex plans as \"as if cloud-1.0 economics still applied,\" Haissl wrote, referring to the low-cost structure of cloud-based services that allowed Big Tech firms to boom in the 2010s. But there are a few problems that suggest the AI boom likely won't play out in the same way, and it is is probably far more costly than investors realize, he said. \"We downgrade Amazon and Microsoft with a heavy heart,\" Haissl wrote, noting that the firm had held a bullish view on the two stocks for the last several years. \"But after turning over every stone, we no longer see a credible path back to cloud 1.0 economics. The market, however, still prices in that outcome, implying returns we believe are no longer achievable,\" he added. There are key differences between the business model for \"cloud 1.0\" and generative AI, Haissl said. For one , AI is far more costly. According to Rothchild's analysis, a GPU costs firms around $40 billion in capex per gigawatt of power. It's also believed to generate less revenue. Each GPU generates around $10 billion of revenue per gigawatt, per the firm's calculations. Rothschild &amp; Co Redburn Amazon, Microsoft, Meta, Alphabet, and Apple are on track to spend around $349 billion in capex this year, much of which is directed toward AI infrastructure, according to company statements. \"We are not concerned about operating margins; those can be managed. The real constraint is the capex required relative to the growth delivered,\" Haissl said, later adding that he believed the market was overestimating the returns related to AI investment. Second , AI chips are also known to have a short lifespan, another factor that can make projects costly. If a GPU were to be replaced every three years, projects would turn \"value destructive,\" according to Rothchild's estimates, implying losses for the owners of the chips. Third, hyperscalers have limited pricing power, Haissl said, pointing to the expenses associated with AI hardware, which is largely provided by tech startups. \"Passing higher costs on to startups would simply deepen their losses unless those costs could be pushed through to end users; if not, hyperscaler economics deteriorate further,\" he said. Amazon and Microsoft already look like they're \"re-rated meaningfully\" in price, Haissl said, pointing to the recent declines in both stocks. Amazon shares are down around 13% from their peak in early November, while Microsoft shares are down 10% from their peak in late October. \"While there may still be some upside to growth, we believe it is limited relative to buy-side expectations and, more importantly, less relevant given the low value of that growth,\" Haissl said. That's not to say the firm is turning completely negative on Amazon and Microsoft. It's hard to hash out a bear case for the near-term for these stocks, Haissl wrote, adding that the firm believed both would continue to post strong growth figures over the next year. \"In our view, it is not a bear case — but it is no longer a bull case either,\" he said, adding that the firm would need to see high growth and a \"meaningful reduction in capex\" in order to turn more optimistic. It's a fragile time for the AI trade, with tech stocks sinking in recent weeks as investors take stock of high valuations and begin to doubt the billions being sown into AI-related investments. The tech-heavy Nasdaq 100 is down 6% from its high in late October. The Roundhill Magnificent Seven ETF , which tracks the seven tech titans at the heart of the AI trade, is down 7% from its peak last month.

Here’s an excerpt from the episode: There’s a few great examples right now. There’s probably a lot of great examples right now. Apple, Apple’s an awesome company. Two of my closest friends work there. I wish it well. I love their products. But its current PE is $39 or so. Long-term, it’s $14 to $15. That’s its average where it’s at for a long time. That means that Apple could drop 50% tonight and it would still be really overvalued relative to its historic norm. Again, great company. But same with Microsoft. Microsoft has a price of sales of almost $14 now. One of my favorite quotes within the market is a quote by Scott McNealy, who is the former CEO of- Tobias: Sun Microsystems. Seth: -Sun Microsystems. I believe he was getting a hard time for losing people’s money. I’m sure he was sued for people investing at the peak of the tech bubble, and then getting mad at him. But he was like, “Look, I’m running the company. You’re the ones that paid 10 times price of sales. That meant that over 10 years, we had to return every single penny in revenue just for you to break even. Not make money for you to break even, which assumes that we have no employees. We’re running a big company. We had a lot of employees. It assumes that we have no cost of goods sold or R&amp;D. We’re a tech company. We have to constantly innovate. And also assumes that you don’t pay taxes. If you guys don’t pay taxes, you go to prison. So, don’t come to me about you paying 10 times price to sales.” The thing is, both Microsoft and Oracle are 40% beyond that. So, 40% beyond the very peak of the tech bubble. Now, we’re in a dynamic time. I don’t know how this plays out with AI. I have a sense of how it plays out, but regardless, I don’t know how it’ll play out. But the main thing to answer your question, is that’s just risk. 40% beyond the tech bubble, maybe it works out, but what if it doesn’t? And so, that’s our goal, is to really avoid that what if. Because what if almost always comes to pass. It does very often. And so, Microsoft, again, awesome company, seems to be leading the AI battle at the moment. But it could drop 70%, and it wouldn’t be a big deal. It would not be a steal if Microsoft drops dropped 70%. Maybe on a PE basis, it would be a lot more attractive. So, again, that focus on valuations and avoiding companies that should go down, let alone a whole lot, is probably our biggest, our greatest value add. But another area where I feel will be very important over the next decade is debt. We all know that if we max out our credit cards to go buy a boat or something, that it’s probably not going to work out very well. We’re headed for some pain. In the last decade, companies took on more debt than any time in history, not to build better companies that could then pay that interest, pay down that principal, and make profit on top of it. They just bought back stock. Buying stock has some benefits. But if you really think of it as most simplest form, basically, these companies mortgage their futures because they got to pay that back at some point, and then they handed that cash to discerning individuals who were selling their stock. Tobias: [laughs] Seth: Again, it’s neither good nor bad buying stock. It could be both ways. But if you’re mortgaging your future to do it, that’s taking on risk. And they did that when interest rates were quite low. Interest rates are now a lot higher. So, more than likely, these companies are going to have to a lot of them are going to have to refinance at higher rates, which will hurt profitability. Profitability is one of the main arguments for better or worse. I actually think it’s a dumb argument. But one of the main arguments for higher PEs or higher multiples. So, if you see profitability decline and you see multiples decline, now you’ve got like a double whammy and contraction. And that just assumes the company is performing just as well as it always has. That’s not assuming any adversity. That’s assuming just reality. And so, avoiding that, I believe, will be a significant value add going forward. Tobias: You’re starting to sound like us, Seth. Jake: [laughs] Seth: I think that’s as a complement. Tobias: Fitting right in. Jake: Other than that, though. Seth: Let’s go. Jake: Yeah. [chuckles] Tobias: What a crazy bet. Jake: Yeah.

Follow us on Google News and set us as your preferred source. Google News Preferred Source Xbox Series consoles could face another price increase soon, with a leaker saying Microsoft has warned partners about serious RAM shortages and that it could affect the Xbox hardware very soon. Xbox players have already watched prices climb more than once in 2025 alone. Back in May, Microsoft pushed the US price of the Xbox Series X from $499.99 to $599.99 , moved the 512 GB Xbox Series S from $299.99 to $379.99 , and set the 2 TB Galaxy Black model at $729.99. Then, starting October 3, there was a second round of US hikes, with the 512 GB Series S rising again to $399.99, the 1 TB Series S to $449.99 , the all-digital Series X to $599.99 , the standard Series X to $649.99 , and the 2 TB special edition jumping to $799.99 , with some accessories also creeping up in price this year.

Game Pass recently went through its biggest overhaul so far, with Xbox Game Pass Ultimate jumping from $19.99 to $29.99 a month , PC Game Pass going up as well, and the old tiers reshuffled under new names. Now, a new claim suggests another price increase for Xbox’s current-generation consoles could be on the way, and it may not be far off. Leaker claims RAM shortages are putting pressure on Xbox The new claims come from a new video by tech YouTuber and leaker Moore’s Law Is Dead, who says he has spoken with multiple contacts at memory makers, retailers, and partners. The video focuses on OpenAI ‘s huge long-term memory deals with Samsung and SK hynix that could lock in up to around 900,000 DRAM wafers a month, which some estimates say could be close to 40% of the world’s total DRAM output once it is fully ramped. This massive deal led to panic buying of RAMs from other companies, creating a serious shortage that is already forcing up costs for everyone who needs large amounts of RAM or GDDR. In short, the idea is that AI data centers are taking a huge chunk of the total memory supply. That leaves less room for more “normal” products like graphics cards, laptops, and yes, consoles. Vendors who did not secure long-term supply earlier now have to fight over what is left at much higher prices.

According to his sources, Microsoft has apparently warned certain partners that RAM shortages could impact Xbox Series consoles “very, very soon.” “[Microsoft] didn’t plan ahead at all, apparently,” Moore’s Law is Dead said in the video. “If you still want an Xbox for some reason at their current pricing, those prices could go up soon, or supply could just entirely dry up because multiple sources of mine have apparently been warned by sales reps at Microsoft that this is going to affect the Xbox Series consoles very, very soon. Sooner rather than later.” On the other side, the insider says PlayStation is in a stronger position for now. His claim is that Sony bought massive amounts of GDDR6 when prices were low, giving the PS5 more breathing room for the next couple of months. “From what I’ve heard, Sony planned ahead, bought up gobs of RAM near the bottom of the pricing, and thus they should be fine for months,” he said. “They have plenty of GDDR6, at least that’s what I’m told. Prices could go up eventually; I could see that happening next year… but there is a reason Sony is cutting PlayStation 5 pricing for Black Friday.

They can afford to do it; apparently, they are not worried about the RAM shortage, at least in the short to mid term.” The Game Post has reached out to Microsoft for a comment on these claims and will update this story if we receive a response. As always with this sort of thing, none of this is official, so it should be taken with a grain of salt until Microsoft or Sony comments. All of this lands at the same time, Xbox president Sarah Bond is out there talking about what comes after the Series X and Series S. In a recent interview with Fortune , she said that “hardware is absolutely core to everything that we do at Xbox,” and said the team is working on a next-generation console that will be a “powerful experience” for players. In a separate chat about the future console with Mashable , Bond described the next Xbox as “a very premium, very high-end curated experience,” hinting at a more PC like hybrid system that shares some of the thinking behind the ROG Xbox Ally handhelds and is built around Windows-style flexibility.
