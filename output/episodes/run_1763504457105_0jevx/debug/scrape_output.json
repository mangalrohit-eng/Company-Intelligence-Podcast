Neymar is once again at the center of the market. Neymar's contract with Santos ends on December 31 this year. Neymar will become a free agent in January next year. The number of teams watching Neymar's situation is increasing rapidly. \"Pre-contact with Neymar has begun,\" said Fabrizio Romano, an expert on the European soccer transfer market. 사진 확대 Neymar.

It is a basic level of understanding of the situation. Romano said: \"Neymar is focused on preventing Santos relegation. However, it will be the FA in January next year. We need to pay attention,\" he said. Neymar is having a difficult time in Santos. The aftermath of the injury remains, and the performance falls short of expectations. 사진 확대 Neymar in pain. 사진=AFPBBNews=News1 The team situation is worse. Santus has 9 wins, 9 draws and 15 losses (36 points) in 33 games in the first division of Brazilian professional football this season. Santus remains 16th out of 20 clubs in the Brazilian Professional Football League. In the first division of Brazilian professional football, 17th to 20th places will be demoted every season. Santos is one point ahead of 17th-place Vitoria, which is in the relegation zone. Santos has five games left this season. 사진 확대 Neymar, the living legend of Brazil. 사진=AFPBBNews=News1 Neymar is likely to leave the team after this season. If Neymar appears in the transfer market as an FA, European big league teams will have no choice but to react. In particular, Neymar dreams of a 2026 North American World Cup challenge. Neymar has a desire to prove his strength in the European big leagues. The Sun, a British media outlet, cited five EPL teams that could seek to recruit Neymar. 사진 확대 Chelsea players. Photo = AFP = Yonhap News The first team is Chelsea. The link between Chelsea and Neymar is old. Chelsea signed Neymar with FC Barcelona in 2010. It was time for Neymar to emerge as the best talent in South America since Lionel Messi. Neymar's name was also mentioned when owner Todd Boehly served as acting sports director in 2022. Chelsea are troubled by Cole Palmer's frequent injuries. Neymar could add to Chelsea's attacking diversity. 사진 확대 Manchester United manager Amorim. Photo (Manchester, England) =ⓒAFPBBNews = News1 The second candidate who can embrace Neymar is Manchester United. United do not hesitate to make a topical choice. Cristiano Ronaldo's re-entry is a good example. Neymar is also a name that has been on Manchester United's recruitment list several times. Key Brazilian national team players such as Matheus Cunha and Casemiro are playing for Manchester United. Neymar's team adaptation could be easy. Neymar's high weekly pay is a stumbling block, but it is worth investing in terms of marketing and issues. Manchester United is also a very good star marketing team. 사진 확대 Manchester City manager Pep Guardiola. 사진=AFPBBNews=News1 The Sun also cited Manchester City as a possible team to embrace Neymar. Manchester City has Pep Guardiola, one of the greatest masters of all time. I can't guarantee Neymar will be able to melt into Guardiola football. However, if Guardiola is a coach, there is an expectation that Neymar will be able to boost his skills after his prime. Neymar's age doesn't really matter. Manchester City had sought to sign Ronaldo before returning to Manchester United. Manchester City also re-entered and utilized Ilkay Gündogan, who is in his mid-30s. The team where \"Chelsea Legend\" Frank Lampard spent the last time is also Manchester City. From next year, you may see a picture of Neymar rocking and Elling Holan finishing. 사진 확대 Liverpool striker Mohamed Salah. Can we see Salah and Neymar playing together in the same age. 사진=AFPBBNews=News1 The fourth team with the potential to recruit Neymar is Liverpool. Liverpool has a familiar Alisson with Neymar. Roberto Firmino is still in the minds of Liverpool fans. EPL's 'defending champion' Liverpool is shaking greatly. The biggest concern is the completeness of the attack. Neymar's rich experience and unique style can be a huge boost to the team's rebound. However, Liverpool invested astronomical money in recruiting Florian Birz and Alexander Isaac this summer. Liverpool have the potential to enter the Neymar recruitment campaign if it is a 'short-term contract'. 사진 확대 Newcastle manager Eddie Howe at the press conference.

If Neymar wears a Newcastle jersey, he can adapt quickly. Newcastle are a team thirsty for a superstar. Newcastle is also participating in the UEFA Champions League (UCL) by attracting Saudi Arabian capital, but has never succeeded in recruiting a \"superstar.\" Newcastle are rated as 'lack of creativity in attack' this season. Neymar could be Newcastle's answer.
