( Getty Images/Visionhaus ) In short: Premier League clubs will be restricted to 85 per cent of their football revenue for on-field spending. The league says the new regulations are more closely aligned to those used by UEFA. What next? The spending caps will be introduced in the 2026/27 Premier League season. abc.net.au/news/football-england-premier-league-to-introduce-spending-cap/106040116 Link copied Share Share article Premier League teams have agreed to introduce spending caps in England's top flight from next season. On-field spending among the clubs will be restricted to 85 per cent of their football revenue and net profit or loss on player sales. There will also be an allowance of an extra 30 per cent but if clubs exceed that limit, they face a points deduction. English football's top clubs voted to implement the new \"Squad Cost Ratio\" (SCR) and \"Sustainability and Systemic Resilience\" financial rules. They replace the \"Profitability and Sustainability Rules\" (PSR), which resulted in points deductions for Everton and Nottingham Forest in recent years. The league said the new regulations were more closely aligned to those used by European football's governing body UEFA. It said the rules promoted \"the opportunity for all of its clubs to aspire to greater success, while protecting the competitive balance and compelling nature of the League\". Squad costs cover the salaries of players and the head coach, as well as agents' and transfer fees. The league said club-generated revenues could include commercial deals and net profits from non-football events hosted at the stadium, such as concerts. Under PSR, clubs' profit included all revenues and costs, rather than focusing on on-field spending. \"By concentrating on squad costs, SCR gives clubs greater freedom to invest in other aspects of their operations,\" the league said. SCR will also set spending limits each season, rather than assessing financial performance over a rolling three-year basis, as was previously the case.
