Akul Saxena Nov 19, 2025 — 1 min read Photo of Dan Schulman , CEO of Verizon CHAT LinkedIn X (Twitter) Facebook Bluesky Mastodon WASHINGTON, Nov. 14, 2025 — Verizon planned to cut about 15,000 jobs as new Chief Executive Dan Schulman moved to restructure the company in response to intensifying wireless competition. Related to what you are reading now Verizon Fixed Wireless Adds Continue to Slow Charter to Lay Off 1,200 Workers The layoffs would represent about 15 percent of Verizon’s U.S. workforce and mark the company’s largest reduction to date. Reuters reported that non-union management positions would fall by more than 20 percent and that roughly 180 corporate-owned retail stores, about 8 percent of Verizon’s total, would shift to franchised operations. Schulman, who took over in October after leading PayPal, said last month that Verizon needed to lower costs and “fundamentally restructure” its expense base. His comments came as AT&amp;T and T-Mobile expanded aggressive promotions tied to new iPhone models in an effort to retain and attract subscribers. Verizon reported a net loss of 7,000 postpaid phone customers in the third quarter. T-Mobile, by contrast, posted more than one million net additions, its strongest performance to date. The results reflected sharply different subscriber trends among the major wireless carriers. The job cuts followed earlier reductions. Verizon shed nearly 20,000 positions over the past three years through voluntary programs and restructuring efforts. The company also made major financial commitments, including $52 billion for midband spectrum in 2021 and an acquisition of Frontier Communications’ assets in 2024. Officials with Verizon failed to return repeated phone calls and and emails seeking a reply or comment.&nbsp; Join the Broadband Community for FREE!

The company’s solid revenue base continues to anchor its long-term outlook. See our latest analysis for Verizon Communications. Verizon’s share price has inched up recently, putting in a 3.16% year-to-date price return. The stock’s one-year total shareholder return of 5.73% shows its ability to reward patient investors remains steady, even as short-term momentum fades. If you’re curious about what’s performing beyond telecom, this could be the perfect time to discover fast growing stocks with high insider ownership But with Verizon currently trading at a double-digit discount to analyst targets, does recent underperformance suggest hidden value, or is the market correctly anticipating slower growth ahead? Is there a real buying opportunity here? Advertisement Most Popular Narrative: 12.7% Undervalued Compared to Verizon’s recent close, the most widely followed narrative attaches a notably higher fair value, suggesting substantial upside if narrative assumptions hold. The latest market price is firmly below where the narrative projects shares should trade in the future. The scalable C-band 5G rollout (tracking ahead of schedule and targeting 80, 90% coverage) strengthens Verizon's competitive advantage in network quality and capacity, enabling premium offerings to meet increasing video, data, and streaming usage and supporting pricing power that could drive higher ARPU and improved margins. Read the complete narrative. What if Verizon’s valuation is powered by bold growth bets on wireless expansion and pricing potential? The most popular narrative is built on headline-grabbing future profit margins, ambitious top-line assumptions, and a belief in out-executing rivals. Want to see the numbers that could send this stock higher? Uncover the key projections driving this bullish target. Result: Fair Value of $47.53 (UNDERVALUED) Have a read of the narrative in full and understand what's behind the forecasts. However, continued industry price wars or weak growth from new tech such as private networks could cast doubt on Verizon’s ability to hit long-term targets.
