Goldman Sachs research predicts that global data centres will consume 165% more electricity by 2030.&nbsp; Meanwhile, Accenture finds that only 8% of enterprises have managed to scale AI projects beyond the pilot stage. The future challenges of AI infrastructure Current data centres consume around 55GW of electricity globally. Accenture’s study finds: 42% are “experimenting with AI” 43% are “progressing with AI” 15% achieve “AI reinvention-ready” status Today, business applications like email consume about a third of that power, while AI workloads account for just 14%.&nbsp; But Goldman Sachs expects this picture to flip dramatically by 2027, with total consumption jumping to 84GW and AI claiming more than a quarter of all power usage. A single ChatGPT query burns through 2.9 watt-hours of electricity – nearly ten times what a Google search requires.&nbsp; Where traditional cloud server racks might be less hungry for power, their AI equivalents are hungrier, consuming ten times as much electricity due to the intensive requirements of training and running machine learning (ML) models. Europe faces a particularly daunting reality.&nbsp; Alberto Gandolfi, Managing Director, Equity Research at Goldman Sachs “Inflecting power demand is monumentally important, because it’s been declining for 15 years in Europe,” says Alberto Gandolfi, Managing Director, Equity Research at Goldman Sachs. Goldman Sachs estimates the continent needs a data centre pipeline of roughly 170GW – equivalent to a third of Europe’s entire current electricity consumption.&nbsp; US utilities alone need to spend US$50bn on new generation capacity just for data centres, while global grid upgrades could cost US$720bn through 2030. Frank Long, a Vice President at the Goldman Sachs Global Institute Frank Long, a Vice President at the Goldman Sachs Global Institute, suggests: “Retrofitting existing facilities to support these massive jumps in power density is becoming complex and compromised.&nbsp; “We will need new, purpose-built AI infrastructure to power the next generation.” The enterprise scaling crisis unveiled&nbsp; While this infrastructure race accelerates, most companies are struggling to even deploy AI. Accenture’s survey of 2,000 C-suite and data science executives from billion-dollar companies finds a growing gap between ambition and execution.&nbsp; They sorted organisations into three categories: 42% are still struggling with limited pilots, 43% are making some progress with implementation – and just 15% achieve “AI reinvention-ready” status. Within that final group, only 8% qualify as genuine front-runners who’ve successfully scaled multiple strategic AI initiatives across their operations.&nbsp; The barriers are both technical and deeply human.&nbsp; Poor data readiness remains the biggest stumbling block, especially with unstructured data.&nbsp; While legacy IT systems create friction – and building multi-disciplinary teams proves difficult.&nbsp; Gartner predicts at least 30% of AI pilots in 2025 will be abandoned due to poor data quality, weak governance, rising costs or unclear business value. Julie Sweet, Chair and CEO at Accenture “We are writing the playbook for how to be the most AI-enabled, client-focused professional services company in the world,” says Julie Sweet, Chair and CEO, Accenture .&nbsp; The scaling priority: Walking before running&nbsp; So how do the 8% crack the code?&nbsp; KPMG ’s research reveals that deploying AI isn’t enough – businesses need a structured approach and strong foundation to overcome scaling challenges.&nbsp; Its analysis identifies five critical strategies. Adopt a phased approach: Focus on high‑impact, low‑risk AI use cases first to assess readiness, prove early value and build alignment for scaling. Build a strong data foundation: Invest in governance, cleansing and integration to ensure quality, accessible data, since poor data guarantees poor AI outcomes. Implement MLOps: Standardise deployment, monitoring and maintenance of AI models to improve reliability, efficiency and performance in production environments. Upskill the workforce: Develop internal AI skills through training and expert partnerships, involving users early in pilots to reduce resistance and drive adoption. Foster cross‑functional collaboration: Align AI initiatives with real business goals by engaging leadership, IT and operations, defining clear KPIs and consistently demonstrating value. It seems that success isn’t about having the grandest infrastructure – it’s about knowing how to use it.

What's The Stock-Specific Risk? More from Trefis All Companies Information Technology IT Consulting &amp; Other Services Accenture Is the Market Overlooking Accenture Stock's Next Move? Share Provide Feedback Base Why Accenture Is Worth A Look As Value Stock Published on: 11/17/2025 &nbsp; Here is why we think Accenture (ACN) stock deserves consideration as a value stock. It is currently trading nearly 37% below its 1 year high, and also trading at a PS multiple which is below the average for the last 3 years. However, it is growing, even though modestly, and has strong margins to go with its low valuation. &nbsp; Accenture's strategic pivot to generative AI is dramatically changing its trajectory, with FY2025 revenue from this segment tripling to $2.7 billion and bookings nearly doubling to $5.9 billion. The firm’s $3 billion multi-year AI investment and recent consolidation into \"Reinvention Services\" fuels client demand, contributing to overall FY2025 revenue of $69.7 billion and $80.6 billion in bookings, demonstrating sustained market share expansion despite a challenging macroeconomic environment. &nbsp; Let's talk numbers &nbsp; Revenue Growth : 7.4% LTM and 4.2% last 3 year average. Low growth, but this is a margin and value play. Strong Margin : Nearly 14.4% 3-year average operating margin. No Major Margin Shocks : Accenture has avoided any large large margin collapse in the last 12 months. Modest Valuation : Despite encouraging fundamentals, ACN stock trades at a PE multiple of 19.9 As a quick background, Accenture provides strategy, consulting, technology, and operations services, including application modernization, agile transformation, AI, data management, intelligent automation, and talent and organizational consulting. &nbsp; &nbsp; ACN S&amp;P Median Sector Information Technology - Industry IT Consulting &amp; Other Services - PE Ratio 19.9 23.4 &nbsp; &nbsp; LTM* Revenue Growth 7.4% 6.1% 3Y Average Annual Revenue Growth 4.2% 5.4% LTM Operating Margin Change -0.1% 0.2% &nbsp; &nbsp; LTM* Operating Margin 14.7% 18.8% 3Y Average Operating Margin 14.4% 18.2% LTM* Free Cash Flow Margin 15.6% 13.5% &nbsp; Asset allocation is a smarter path than stock picking. The asset allocation strategies of Trefis’ Boston-based, wealth management partner yielded positive returns during the 2008-09 period when the S&amp;P lost more than 40%. And now, Trefis High Quality Portfolio is part of it. &nbsp; For full story on fundamentals, read Buy or Sell ACN Stock to see if Accenture still has an edge that holds up under the hood. &nbsp; What's The Evidence That This Can Work?

The company’s 791,000 employees has been cut down to 779,000 in the past three months, and Accenture might not be done yet. With AI continuing to dominate the tech space, &nbsp;the IT consulting group has introduced AI training for staff to keep up with this new era of technology. &nbsp; Accenture has warned staff who cannot keep up with the new training could join the thousands already laid off.&nbsp; In a discussion with analysts , Accenture CEO Julie Sweet provided further insights into the restructuring : “We are exiting on a compressed timeline people where reskilling, based on our experience, is not a viable path for the skills we need. &nbsp; We are investing in upskilling our reinventors, which is our primary strategy. Those we cannot reskill will be exited. Indeed, Accenture followed this announcement with the news that it is set to acquire Aidemy Inc, a reskilling specialist. In doing so, the company is looking to strengthen its own reskilling and learning service, LearnVantage, and seemingly double-down on its commitment to fully embracing AI. The acquisition will also enhance Accenture’s end-to-end AI support – from talent development to long-term adoption – by leveraging Aidemy’s expertise in building and operating AI systems across diverse industries. Unpacking the Restructure The layoffs are part of an $865MN restructuring program for the year ahead, which aims to improve efficiency within the company. However, despite the restructuring, plans for the new fiscal year expect the employee headcount to grow, particularly in areas such as AI and digital services. &nbsp; Accenture’s fourth quarter report revealed that its revenue had increased by seven percent compared to the previous fiscal year, with Sweet suggesting it demonstrated the company’s “unique ability to deliver for our clients as they seek our help to reinvent and lead with AI”. &nbsp; In the report, Accenture reveals its strategic realignment plan to increase its growth, upskilling and efficiency, driven by a demand for AI-related services, as well as an increase in employment. &nbsp; The projected employee plan is part of a “refreshed three-pronged talent strategy to meet current and future client demand”, exiting those who cannot apply the skills required and hiring those who can. &nbsp; Our overall workforce is positioned to grow in line with the future of digital and AI consulting. Despite an increase in revenue, Accenture has had to adapt to budget constraints after the Department of Government Efficiency slowed its spending earlier this year. &nbsp; In the past, the U.S federal government has accounted for roughly eight percent of the company’s revenue. &nbsp; This year, the report suggests that with government spending, the projected revenue of Fiscal Year 25 would have been a percentage point higher. &nbsp; However, after the restructuring was announced, Accenture’s shares dropped 2.7 percent, the lowest since November 2020, after concerns were raised over the plan’s costs. &nbsp; Accenture is All In on AI This restructuring is only the latest in Accenture’s plans to target the AI space. &nbsp; At the end of August, the company acquired NeuraFlash , expanding its expertise in Agentic AI and enhancing its capabilities. &nbsp; The company has also partnered with several other companies in the past few years to boost its AI knowledge in AI-powered insights, GenAI, digital experiences, and data analytics. &nbsp; Despite the market’s less than enthusiastic response to Accenture’s layoffs, it will be interesting to see whether the company’s commitment to betting big on AI will pay dividends in the long run.
