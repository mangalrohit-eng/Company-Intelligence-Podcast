   ROOT CAUSE CONFIRMED                                     


SMOKING GUN FOUND IN DEBUG FILES:

 Discover:      100 Citibank articles found
 Disambiguate:  47 articles passed
 Rank:          47 articles ranked
 Scrape:        47 "successful" scrapes
 PROBLEM:       Scraped content = "Google News" (11 chars)
 Extract:       0 evidence units (nothing to extract)


THE ISSUE:

Google News RSS feeds link to redirect URLs like:
  https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMi...?oc=5

These are NOT the actual article pages. They're Google News proxy 
pages that:
1. Show "Google News" text
2. Redirect browsers (with JavaScript) to the real article
3. Basic HTTP fetch just gets the proxy page, not the article


SCRAPE OUTPUT PROOF:

{
  "url": "https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMi...",
  "title": "Putin gives green light for sale of Citibank's...",
  "contentLength": 11,
  "contentPreview": "Google News"  <-- ONLY 11 CHARACTERS!
}


Every scraped "article" is literally just "Google News" text.
No wonder Extract found 0 evidence units!


SOLUTION:

Option 1: Follow HTTP redirects to get actual article URLs
Option 2: Parse Google News URL to extract real article URL
Option 3: Use better news sources (Yahoo Finance, company IR, etc.)


I'm implementing Option 1 + 3 now...
