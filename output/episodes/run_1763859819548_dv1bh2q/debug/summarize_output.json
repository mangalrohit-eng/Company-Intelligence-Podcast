This number isn't just a testament to the telecommunications giant's size but also a crucial piece of the puzzle as the company navigates through transformative times.

As Verizon stands on this pivotal threshold, it's clear that every employee plays a part in steering the company towards its redefined trajectory, making each of the 99,600 workers integral to its journey ahead.",
