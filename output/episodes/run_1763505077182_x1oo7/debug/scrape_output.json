Neymar is once again at the center of the market. Neymar's contract with Santos ends on December 31 this year. Neymar will become a free agent in January next year. The number of teams watching Neymar's situation is increasing rapidly. \"Pre-contact with Neymar has begun,\" said Fabrizio Romano, an expert on the European soccer transfer market. 사진 확대 Neymar.

It is a basic level of understanding of the situation. Romano said: \"Neymar is focused on preventing Santos relegation. However, it will be the FA in January next year. We need to pay attention,\" he said. Neymar is having a difficult time in Santos. The aftermath of the injury remains, and the performance falls short of expectations. 사진 확대 Neymar in pain. 사진=AFPBBNews=News1 The team situation is worse. Santus has 9 wins, 9 draws and 15 losses (36 points) in 33 games in the first division of Brazilian professional football this season. Santus remains 16th out of 20 clubs in the Brazilian Professional Football League. In the first division of Brazilian professional football, 17th to 20th places will be demoted every season. Santos is one point ahead of 17th-place Vitoria, which is in the relegation zone. Santos has five games left this season. 사진 확대 Neymar, the living legend of Brazil. 사진=AFPBBNews=News1 Neymar is likely to leave the team after this season. If Neymar appears in the transfer market as an FA, European big league teams will have no choice but to react. In particular, Neymar dreams of a 2026 North American World Cup challenge. Neymar has a desire to prove his strength in the European big leagues. The Sun, a British media outlet, cited five EPL teams that could seek to recruit Neymar. 사진 확대 Chelsea players. Photo = AFP = Yonhap News The first team is Chelsea. The link between Chelsea and Neymar is old. Chelsea signed Neymar with FC Barcelona in 2010. It was time for Neymar to emerge as the best talent in South America since Lionel Messi. Neymar's name was also mentioned when owner Todd Boehly served as acting sports director in 2022. Chelsea are troubled by Cole Palmer's frequent injuries. Neymar could add to Chelsea's attacking diversity. 사진 확대 Manchester United manager Amorim. Photo (Manchester, England) =ⓒAFPBBNews = News1 The second candidate who can embrace Neymar is Manchester United. United do not hesitate to make a topical choice. Cristiano Ronaldo's re-entry is a good example. Neymar is also a name that has been on Manchester United's recruitment list several times. Key Brazilian national team players such as Matheus Cunha and Casemiro are playing for Manchester United. Neymar's team adaptation could be easy. Neymar's high weekly pay is a stumbling block, but it is worth investing in terms of marketing and issues. Manchester United is also a very good star marketing team. 사진 확대 Manchester City manager Pep Guardiola. 사진=AFPBBNews=News1 The Sun also cited Manchester City as a possible team to embrace Neymar. Manchester City has Pep Guardiola, one of the greatest masters of all time. I can't guarantee Neymar will be able to melt into Guardiola football. However, if Guardiola is a coach, there is an expectation that Neymar will be able to boost his skills after his prime. Neymar's age doesn't really matter. Manchester City had sought to sign Ronaldo before returning to Manchester United. Manchester City also re-entered and utilized Ilkay Gündogan, who is in his mid-30s. The team where \"Chelsea Legend\" Frank Lampard spent the last time is also Manchester City. From next year, you may see a picture of Neymar rocking and Elling Holan finishing. 사진 확대 Liverpool striker Mohamed Salah. Can we see Salah and Neymar playing together in the same age. 사진=AFPBBNews=News1 The fourth team with the potential to recruit Neymar is Liverpool. Liverpool has a familiar Alisson with Neymar. Roberto Firmino is still in the minds of Liverpool fans. EPL's 'defending champion' Liverpool is shaking greatly. The biggest concern is the completeness of the attack. Neymar's rich experience and unique style can be a huge boost to the team's rebound. However, Liverpool invested astronomical money in recruiting Florian Birz and Alexander Isaac this summer. Liverpool have the potential to enter the Neymar recruitment campaign if it is a 'short-term contract'. 사진 확대 Newcastle manager Eddie Howe at the press conference. Photo = Courtesy of Yonhap News Newcastle United is the fifth club that can consider recruiting Neymar selected by The Sun. Neymar is close to Bruno Guimarães and Joelington. If Neymar wears a Newcastle jersey, he can adapt quickly. Newcastle are a team thirsty for a superstar. Newcastle is also participating in the UEFA Champions League (UCL) by attracting Saudi Arabian capital, but has never succeeded in recruiting a \"superstar.\" Newcastle are rated as 'lack of creativity in attack' this season. Neymar could be Newcastle's answer.

Arteta Arsenal have an \"AI dossier\" which is reportedly powering Mikel Arteta's Premier League title pursuit, with the manager being assisted with input on transfers, tactics and even injuries. This quiet revolution is an attempt to build the most technologically advanced operation in English football. They have computer models humming with millions of data points to predict problems before they happen. AI takes over Arsenal HQ According to the Daily Mail, the Gunners have rapidly expanded their data science department, investing heavily in artificial intelligence infrastructure. Competing with Europe’s elite clubs is no mean task, and Arsenal’s leadership have made it clear that they believe staying competitive requires not just talent on the pitch, but intelligence behind the scenes. A well-timed rotation could stop a key player from breaking down. One scouting insight could produce a bargain where others see no value. Arteta has already hinted, albeit cautiously, that the club’s adoption of AI is already underway. \"It’s in use already for many things and many processes that can help not just a team but an organisation as well,\" he said. \"It will improve and it will give us good insight, or things at least to think about. I’m not an expert but it’s a valuable tool. We have developed certain things that in our opinion can help us to understand ourselves better and evaluate what we do and what we can improve.\" Advertisement (C)Getty Images Gunners have in-house performance models The biggest breakthroughs at the club's London Colney base come through their tailor-made performance models, which are AI-driven programs designed internally by Arsenal's data scientists. Every day, enormous volumes of information are collected, including GPS sprint maps, recovery times, energy outputs, bio-mechanical readings, match actions, and even micro-movements during training drills. Unlike traditional analysis, which often relies on video clips and subjective assessments, these systems digest tens of thousands of data points from each session. The models then learn patterns about fatigue signals, mechanical inefficiencies, and subtle warning signs with a level of granularity no human eye could catch. The shift is profound as Arsenal are now preparing for what is about to happen, and not reacting to what has just happened. Looking for smarter football bets?

Profiling every player: A live, evolving human data map One major branch of Arsenal’s AI system is individual profiling. Every player, right from academy prospects to first-team starters, has a dynamic profile that logs sprint mechanics, joint stress patterns, muscle fatigue responses and changes under load. This gives Arsenal the ability to personalise training. No two players respond to stress in the same way, and machine learning allows coaches to tailor workloads to match bodies rather than the other way around. These profiles also highlight areas for improvement. Weaknesses can be addressed before they impact performance, which will allow players to train smarter, not harder.&nbsp; The most critical area of Arsenal’s AI application is injury prevention.&nbsp; William Saliba’s back problem derailed Arsenal’s 2022-23 title charge, while last season Kai Havertz’s hamstring injury forced Mikel Merino into an improvised striker role. The models identify clues such as tiny drops in acceleration, altered stride patterns, and minor imbalances that can signal impending muscle injuries. Before a congested fixture, run the system flags players with elevated fatigue risk, which helps Arteta to make an informed decision. Arsenal’s analytics tools also parse opposition patterns frame by frame. Machine learning evaluates how full-backs behave under pressure, how midfield shapes morph in transitions, and where passing lanes appear during pressing triggers. This gives Arteta’s staff the opportunity to build game plans not on hunches, but on probability maps.

Beyond traditional metrics like goals or tackles, Arsenal’s models study adaptability across roles, physical intensity benchmarks, tactical compatibility with Arteta’s system, and log behavioural data from hundreds of match scenarios. Every role now has a detailed blueprint, such as what the physical output should look like, how quickly a player must transition, how he presses, and how he receives the ball under pressure. This tech-driven approach allows Arsenal to find undervalued players who might not shine in traditional stats but are ideal fits for Arteta’s structure. Arsenal’s technological leap is bold, advanced and path-breaking. However, whether it can end their 22-year wait for a Premier League title remains to be seen.
