What triggered October's 150,000 job cuts? What is Schulman's restructuring goal? Verizon is set to cut at least 15,000 jobs and convert 180 stores into franchises, marking its largest downsizing ever, according to reports from Reuters, the Wall Street Journal and Bloomberg on Thursday, Nov. 13, citing anonymous sources. The wireless carrier is struggling with market pressures from fewer new customers, as competitors offer cheaper plans and cable companies, including Comcast and Charter, are entering the market. The layoffs are reportedly set to take place as soon as next week and will affect about 15% of Verizon's workforce . Converting company-owned stores into franchises will remove those employees from the telecom giant's payroll, and according to Bloomberg, up to 20,000 jobs will be cut.

The Troy City Council’s finance committee on Nov. 10 recommended preparing legislation to authorize the Director of Public Service and Safety to execute a First Amendment to the city’s 2004 option and land lease agreement with Cellco Partnership, doing business as Verizon Wireless, for the cell tower located on city property at 202 East Staunton Road. Councilmember Sievert, who presented the finance report at the Nov. 17 meeting, said the amendment would include an increase in lease payments and asked that an ordinance be prepared reflecting the general terms and payment amounts outlined in the committee’s report. “It is a recommendation of the committee that legislation be prepared authorizing the Director of Public Service and Safety to execute the First Amendment,” Sievert said during the committee report. Ordinance O30‑2025, described in the clerk’s reading as an ordinance to authorize the director to execute the amendment with Cellco Partnership (DBA Verizon Wireless), was read for the first time and will be carried to the council’s next meeting for second reading because three council members were excused and the body could not suspend the three‑reading rule. The committee report and the ordinance text were presented as first readings only; no final vote or contract execution occurred at the Nov. 17 meeting. The council did not provide detailed financial terms in open session beyond the committee’s summary. The ordinance will return for further consideration at the next regular meeting.

Saf Malik Deputy Editor Share Share on LinkedIn Share on Twitter Copy Link URL 1239px --> The cuts, the largest in Verizon’s history , are expected to begin within days and will fall heavily on non-union management, where more than a fifth of roles are set to disappear. As part of the shake-up, Verizon also plans to convert around 180–200 corporate-owned retail stores into franchised outlets, shifting those positions off its direct payroll. The move comes just weeks after Schulman, the former PayPal chief and long-time Verizon board member, stepped into the CEO role . Internally, he has described the plan as a “cost transformation”, arguing that Verizon must “fundamentally restructure our expense base” to become a “simpler, leaner and scrappier business”. Schulman inherits a company facing mounting pressure. Verizon added only 44,000 postpaid wireless subscribers in the most recent quarter, significantly trailing AT&amp;T and T-Mobile, both of which continue to use aggressive pricing and bundling strategies to capture market share. Meanwhile, cable operators such as Comcast and Charter are expanding their mobile footprints, adding further competitive strain. Rather than rely on further price increases, a tactic Verizon has used repeatedly in recent years, Schulman is pivoting towards operational efficiency and customer-focused investments. The job cuts are expected to unlock substantial savings, with analysts projecting up to $1 billion in gross annualised reductions from 2026. However, the strategy is not without risk. Cutting such a large slice of management threatens to unsettle internal operations, disrupt leadership continuity, and potentially slow the execution of key programmes. The franchise shift, while reducing overheads, may also weaken Verizon’s control over retail customer experience at a time when churn remains a critical metric. Verizon’s past strategy leaned heavily on investment-led expansion, including major spending on mid-band 5G spectrum and acquisitions such as TracFone. Schulman’s approach signals a notable shift: less emphasis on large-scale capex bets and more on structural efficiency, performance accountability and cost discipline. Analysts say the overhaul is necessary but caution that cost-cutting alone will not fix Verizon’s momentum problem. The company must simultaneously improve customer retention, elevate its value proposition, and ensure its network leadership narrative remains credible as rivals accelerate 5G and fibre rollouts . For Schulman, the job cuts are only the opening act of what is likely to be one of the most consequential turnarounds in Verizon’s history.

Home Tech Verizon latest company to slash workforce, cut 15,000 jobs in biggest-ever reduction Industry Tech Verizon latest company to slash workforce, cut 15,000 jobs in biggest-ever reduction By John Harrington (New York) - November 17, 2025 Facebook Twitter Linkedin Verizon Communications intends to slash about 15,000 jobs, or 15% of its workforce, in the coming week in its largest round of layoffs, according to The Wall Street Journal. T he company has battled subscriber losses, rising operational costs and competition in the wireless and Internet markets .&nbsp; Verizon has 100,000 employees, making it the 12th-biggest telecom by employee ranking. The company’s operations headquarters are in Basking Ridge. It is not known yet how many employees in New Jersey will lose their jobs. Verizon does not keep a static dataset of employees by state. Some recent reports have also said the New York City-based company, which had revenue of $134.8 billion in 2024, plans to convert its retail stores to franchises. Sources told the Journal that the job reductions are part of an extensive cost-reduction effort as the company faces greater competition in the wireless and home internet markets, sources told the WSJ. Verizon has lost postpaid phone subscribers for three straight quarters as competitors continue to lure customers away. The company, like its rivals, is also losing customers who are cutting the cord on cable service and moving to other platforms. Newly installed Chief Executive Officer Daniel Schulman, who took over Verizon in October, has said he will make deep cost reductions to try and reverse customer losses and wants to make Verizon a more nimble company.&nbsp; Verizon is just the latest large company to announce layoffs this year. Amazon recently said it was eliminating about 14,000 corporate roles to simplify operations and respond more quickly to technological change. International Business Machines Corp. (IBM) said earlier this month that it will trim thousands of jobs in the fourth quarter as it moves toward faster-growing areas such as AI consulting and software. The United Parcel Service (UPS) said in its third-quarter earnings report on Oct. 28 that it has slashed about 34,000 jobs as part of a broad cost-cutting effort to boost profits. Verizon shares were little changed on Nov. 14. Its stock has gained 2.63% to $41.03 year to date. Verizon has a market cap of $173 billion, making it the fifth-largest telecom company by market cap.

Subscribe to MediaDailyNews Verizon Asks SCOTUS To Review Privacy Fine by Wendy Davis , November 14, 2025 Verizon has asked the Supreme Court to review a lower court decision upholding a $47 million fine imposed by the Federal Communications Commission over alleged privacy violations. The telecom argues in a petition made public this week that the fine, which was imposed last year, violated the company's 7th Amendment right to a jury trial. Verizon adds that Supreme Court intervention is necessary to protect the right to trial by jury and \"to cabin a sweeping expansion of administrative power.\" The telecom's petition comes in a dispute dating to 2020, when the Federal Communications Commission first proposed fining Verizon, AT&amp;T and T-Mobile for selling access to customers' geolocation data to aggregators that then resold the information. In April 2024, the FCC imposed fines on the three carriers that amounted to around $200 million total&nbsp;–$47 million for Verizon, $57 million for AT&amp;T and $92 million for T-Mobile. advertisement advertisement The carriers paid the fines, then&nbsp; sued &nbsp;to vacate them. Verizon sued in the 2nd Circuit, while T-Mobile brought suit in the D.C. Circuit and AT&amp;T sued in the 5th Circuit. The carriers made similar arguments in the three appellate courts. Among other claims, the companies said the FCC violated their right to a jury trial by acting as both prosecutor and judge. The 2nd Circuit rejected Verizon's argument, ruling that its 7th Amendment right wasn't violated because it could have refused to pay the fine, and then defended itself at a jury trial if the FCC pressed to collect the money. \"Assuming Verizon has a Seventh Amendment right to a trial by jury, those rights were not violated because it had, but chose to forgo, an opportunity for a ...trial,\" the appellate panel wrote. Verizon now argues in its petition with the Supreme Court that it should have been able to make its case to a jury before the FCC ordered the company to pay a fine, not afterwards. The D.C. Circuit also rejected T-Mobile's argument and upheld its fine. But the 5th Circuit came to the opposite conclusion, ruling that the FCC violated AT&amp;T's right to a trial by jury. The FCC last month asked the Supreme Court to review that decision, arguing that it \"severely impairs the agency’s ability to enforce federal communications law.\" AT&amp;T is expected to respond to the FCC's argument in that matter by December 5. The FCC proposed the fines after it&nbsp; came to light &nbsp;that a Missouri sheriff used geolocation data provided by Securus Technology to track other law enforcement officers, without court orders. Securus obtained the location data from the phone carriers. Around one year later, Vice Media's Motherboard detailed how a journalist was able to pay a “bounty hunter” $300 to track a phone's location to a neighborhood in Queens. The major U.S. carriers have said they no longer sell location data. digital , fcc , legal , location-based , mobile , policy , privacy , telecom Comment Next story loading advertisement More from MediaDailyNews Court Sides With Quest In Privacy Battle Meta Defeats Antitrust Suit Over Instagram, WhatsApp Acquisitions Microsoft, Nvidia Invest Billions In Anthropic Realeyes Spins Off 'Adverteyes' To Focus On Ad Performance, Outcomes Meta Aims To Protect Creator-Made Reels From Unauthorized Duplication SPONSOR CONTENT Travel, Treats &amp; Traditions: How Multimodal AI Is Rewriting the Holiday Travel Story The Best Event in Email Marketing",
