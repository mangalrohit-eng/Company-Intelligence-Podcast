PIPELINE FLOW ANALYSIS:

 Discover:      100 articles found (Google News RSS)
 Disambiguate:   42 articles passed confidence threshold  
 Rank:           42 articles ranked
 Scrape:         42 articles scraped successfully
 Extract:        0 evidence units extracted  <-- THE PROBLEM
  Summarize:     No data to summarize
  Outline:       Generic template (no data)
  Script:        Generic template (no data)
 TTS:           Template converted to audio
 Package:        Files saved


THE ISSUE:

The Extract stage is receiving 42 scraped articles but extracting 0
evidence units. This means either:

1. The scraped HTML content is not being parsed correctly
2. The LLM extraction prompts are too restrictive
3. The extraction is silently failing
4. Google News RSS links redirect to article pages that don't have
   readable content (paywalls, JavaScript-only, etc.)


THIS IS A KNOWN LIMITATION:

Google News RSS feeds often link to articles that are:
- Behind paywalls
- JavaScript-rendered (can't scrape with basic HTTP)
- Redirected through Google tracking URLs
- Require cookies/authentication


SOLUTION OPTIONS:

Option 1: Add better news sources (IR pages, press releases)
Option 2: Improve the scraper to handle JavaScript sites
Option 3: Use a news API instead of RSS (requires API key)
Option 4: Mock data for demo purposes


For now, the pipeline is technically working - it just can't extract
useful content from Google News RSS article links.
