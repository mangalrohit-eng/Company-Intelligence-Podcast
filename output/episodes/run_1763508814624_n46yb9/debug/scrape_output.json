Deals By Alex Whitelock published 10 hours ago Both are good, both are potentially expensive Comments (0) ( ) When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works . (Image credit: Future/Lance Ulanoff) This past week, we've been hit with a barrage of early Black Friday iPhone deals from the likes of T-Mobile and Verizon. AT&amp;T's promotions are conspicuously absent, but potential upgraders already have a difficult decision to make between two major carriers. As an overview, both are offering the standard iPhone 17 for free alongside a new unlimited data line without a trade-in right now. That's a real step up from the deals that we saw during the initial pre-order period back in September, when a trade-in was strictly required to get a discount. In terms of which has the better deal, it's almost a dead heat right now, too. There are subtle differences in the carrier's offerings, however, which you should consider carefully. First, here are",

The moves, expected to begin as early as next week, would reduce the company’s U.S. headcount by roughly 15 percent and represent a sweeping effort to reshape its cost structure in an increasingly hostile market accoridng to Reuters . The downsizing would primarily affect non-union management roles, with reports indicating that leadership positions could shrink by more than 20 percent. By converting corporate stores to franchise models, Verizon would effectively shift thousands of retail employees off its direct payroll while maintaining brand presence through independent operators. Some accounts suggest the total job impact could climb as high as 20,000 when factoring in both direct layoffs and the store conversions. At the end of 2024, Verizon employed approximately 100,000 people in the United States, a figure already reduced by nearly 20,000 through various cuts over the previous three years. The latest measures would accelerate that trend and mark a pivotal shift under chief executive Dan Schulman, who has signaled the need for aggressive transformation to create a simpler and more agile organization. The telecommunications giant faces mounting pressure from multiple fronts. Customer growth has slowed dramatically as the smartphone upgrade cycle matures and post-pandemic demand subsides. Competitors continue to undercut pricing through aggressive promotions and bundled offerings, while cable providers such as Comcast and Charter Communications have expanded aggressively into wireless service with their own mobile brands. These dynamics have compressed margins and forced Verizon to re-examine nearly every aspect of its expense base. The planned reductions arrive against a backdrop of widespread corporate belt-tightening across the American economy. October alone saw employers announce more than 150,000 job cuts, the highest monthly total in over two decades according to labor-market tracking firm Challenger, Gray &amp; Christmas. Technology and retail sectors have been particularly hard hit, with Amazon confirming the elimination of 14,000 managerial roles in late October and Target reportedly preparing to shed around 1,800 corporate positions. Verizon’s situation carries additional complexity due to its recent regulatory maneuvering. The Federal Communications Commission recently cleared the company’s $20 billion acquisition of fiber-optic provider Frontier Communications, but only after Verizon agreed to scale back certain diversity, equity, and inclusion initiatives that had drawn political scrutiny. The combination of store franchising and deep management cuts reflects a broader strategic pivot toward capital efficiency and away from labor-intensive retail footprints. Industry observers see the moves as an acknowledgment that traditional wireless carriers must fundamentally rethink operating models built during an era of rapid subscriber expansion that no longer exists. As the company approaches implementation, affected employees and the communities hosting soon-to-be-franchised locations await final details on severance packages, transition support, and the timeline for ownership changes. The scale of the overhaul underscores both the severity of competitive threats in telecommunications and the difficult choices facing legacy carriers in an environment dominated by price competition and converging technologies.

Photo by Joao-Pierre S. Ruth Plenty of arguments dissect AI’s long-term worth, but it is hard to argue with billion-dollar results. C-suite leaders from Verizon and Collectors, the leading third-party grader for collectibles, spoke recently at the OverdriveAI Summit, shedding light on how their companies currently use AI. TechUnited:NJ hosted the summit at Nokia Bell Labs in New Providence, N.J. The event preceded reports of Verizon's plans to lay off 15,000 employees to cut costs amid rising expenses from customer retention. The reported layoffs come just weeks after Dan Schulman, formerly of PayPal, took the reins as CEO in October. Verizon has not yet responded to questions regarding the reported layoffs. Verizon and Collectors operate in very different digital and analog spaces, and use AI for different tasks, but they are seeing its impact on their operations. In the case of telecommunications provider Verizon, AI is used for predictions and efficiency. Meanwhile, Collectors uses the technology to authenticate prized items. As different as their needs are, these tech leaders have growing plans to put AI to work within their enterprises. Verizon’s three-pronged AI strategy Mano Mannoochahr, chief data, analytics and AI officer at Verizon, opened &nbsp;his keynote with an outline of the three-pronged strategy his company has adopted to leverage AI.&nbsp; Related: Salesforce shows off eVerse: Another small step to enterprise general intelligence? Improve the business. Improve customer experience and interactions with Verizon. Enable AI infrastructure. Before Mannoochahr broke down each element of the strategy, he gave a glimpse of where Verizon is headed with some of its efforts. \"We want to bring AI closer and closer to the edge, because that's where it gets consumed most of the time on the phones,\" he said. Internally, Verizon has enabled AI resources for all its employees to enhance knowledge workers' capabilities on strategic tasks, Mannoochahr said. &nbsp;The company has more than 1,000 AI models in production that run various aspects of the business, Mannoochahr said. One of the models is used to predict why current customers call the company by analyzing their experiences on the network over the two weeks preceding the call. \"It's looking at hundreds of data points in real time,\" he said, with the aim of providing concierge customer service.&nbsp; Training AI to know customers Citing himself as an example, Mannoochahr said that when he called Verizon customer service, the AI model presumed he was checking the status of an order he had recently placed for new phones. \"As soon as you're trying to make a touchpoint with us, we've got AI that's already trying to predict why you might be calling us,\" he said.

Once connected with a representative, additional AI models may activate and listen to the conversation with customer service in real time and then offer suggestions on how best to provide assistance, he said. This also means millions of calls to Verizon get digitized and can be consumed by its advertising models for marketing needs, as well as used for other parts of the business, Mannoochahr said. Not all about going big with AI Mannoochahr also cited the following other uses of AI at Verizon:&nbsp; Training a small language model to respond to questions about changes in billing. Working with prescriptive AI designed to predict if a customer might need additional resources to keep them from switching to another carrier.&nbsp; Using generative AI to develop advisory tools that bring data, information, and knowledge together for decision-making.

AI authentication and a house of cards Dan Van Tran, CTO at Collectors, discussed how AI and other changes contributed to his company's growth from a $850 million valuation to $4.3 billion in valuation over 14 months as of 2022. Collectors has since gone private, and Van Tran said the company keeps its current valuation secret. Collectors authenticates and grades collectibles such as trading cards and autographs. Despite being a legacy business, Van Tran said AI assist",
