      "content": "Verizon announced Tuesday that its C-band 5G network now covers 230 million people across the United States, marking a major milestone in the carrier's aggressive mid-band deployment strategy. The company has deployed approximately 45,000 C-band cell sites nationwide, achieving 90% of its initial coverage target six months ahead of schedule.\n\n'This is transformational for our customers,' said Kyle Malady, Verizon's Chief Technology Officer. 'C-band provides the perfect balance of speed and coverage that makes 5G truly useful for everyday applications.'\n\nThe deployment represents a $20 billion investment by Verizon in C-band spectrum and infrastructure. Average download speeds on C-band range from 300-500 Mbps, with peak speeds exceeding 1 Gbps in optimal conditions. The network is now available in over 2,100 cities and towns.\n\nIndustry analysts note this puts Verizon ahead of competitors in mid-band 5G coverage. 'Verizon was late to the mid-band game but has caught up remarkably quickly,' said Roger Entner, founder of Recon Analytics. 'This 230 million POPs milestone demonstrates serious execution capability.'",
