   COMPLETE FIX SUMMARY - ALL DUMMY DATA REMOVED           


 FIXED ISSUES:

1. RUNS NOT SHOWING IN RUNS TAB
   Problem: In-memory runs store was cleared on server restart
   Solution: Modified /api/podcasts/[id]/runs to read from filesystem
   Result: Now shows all 2 completed runs with audio

2. DUMMY DATA IN SUGGESTIONS TAB
   Problem: Hardcoded Tesla, Rivian, Lucid Motors competitors
   Solution: Replaced with "Coming Soon" message
   Result: No more automotive competitors for Citibank!

3. SYNTAX ERROR IN RUN DETAIL PAGE
   Problem: Missing closing fragment tag (</>) 
   Solution: Added proper closing tag before )}
   Result: Run detail page now loads successfully

4. AUDIO PLAYER NOT ACCESSIBLE
   Problem: Page had syntax error preventing load
   Solution: Fixed JSX structure
   Result: Audio player now works with real podcasts
